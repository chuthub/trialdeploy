    <pre style="text-align: right; margin-right:50; font-size: 14px; color: lightblue;">
        I sat out by a lake today,
        thinking,
        dreaming,
        and the dreaming left me longing.
        So I sat there, alone by the lake,
        only to find my words had drifted away. 
        The meanings were there,
        the symbols made sense,
        but the labels were lost to my mind.
        The hours passed
        and I sat there,
        and the meanings became less sure,
        the symbols, too, 
        they drifted along the grassy shore
        dodging trees,
        dipping in the chilly waters,
        dancing with the wind,
        farther away,
        away from me.
        They left without me,
        and I don't remember chasing them.
        And I don't know where the time went.


        But the words were first to go.
