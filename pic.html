    <pre style="text-align: right; margin-right:50; font-size: 14px; color: lightblue;">
        I sat out by a lake today,
        thinking,
        dreaming,
        and the dreaming left me longing.
        So I sat there, aside the lake,
        to find my words had drifted away. 
        The meanings were there,
        the symbols made sense,
        but the labels were lost to my mind.
        As the hours passed
        and I sat there,
        the meanings became less sure,
        the symbols, too. 
        They lilted along the grassy shore
        dodging trees,
        dipping gently into the chilly waters,
        dancing with the wind,
        farther away,
        ever farther away,
        farther away from me.
        They left without me,
        and i sat there, alone on the shore of the glassy water.
        and I don't remember chasing them.
        And I don't know where the time went.


        But the words were surely first to go.
