        I sat out by a lake today,
        thinking and dreaming,
        dreaming and drifting,
        I sat out by a lake today
        and the words were the first thing to go. 
        The meanings were there,
        and the symbols were true,
        but the labels were no where to be found.
        I sat out by the lake today
        as the hours passed,
        and I don't know where time went.
        But the words were the first thing to go.
