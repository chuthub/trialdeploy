        I sat out by a lake today,
        thinking,
        dreaming,
        and the dreaming left me drifting.
        I sat there by the lake today
        and the words were the first thing to go. 
        The meanings were there,
        and the symbols still made sense,
        but the labels were no where to be found.
        As the hours passed
        and I sat there,
        the meanings became less sure,
        the symbols drifted along the grassy shore
        dipping in the chilly waters,
        dancing with the wind,
        without me,
        away from me.
        And I don't remember chasing them.
        and I don't know where time went.
        But the words were the first to go.
